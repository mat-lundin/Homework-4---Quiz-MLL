// WHEN I click the start button - eventlistener
// THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question - start timer loop function, hide start button, create divs for box, question, and each answer
// WHEN I answer a question - eventlistener on container div, event.target on each answer
// THEN I am presented with another question - call same function to create the question from the array object, next index
// WHEN I answer a question incorrectly - function to evaluate correct answer and return true/false?
// THEN time is subtracted from the clock - new timer taking current value and starting a few seconds below that?
// WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 - condition of timer loop plus another function that evaluates all answers given? 
// THEN the game is over - hide the question boxes and display the start button and score
// WHEN the game is over
// THEN I can save my initials and my score - form field to enter initials, save both as separate strings in local storage
